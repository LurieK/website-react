    review: `"What a pleasure to work with Lurie! She programmed the website for my artistic education project. On the one hand, I was very impressed with her programming skills. 
    On the other, she took the project and its external image to the next level with her creative ideas. 
    It was special to experience that level of cocreation with a programmer. I really want to say: thank you, Lurie, for your professional cooperation and support.`,
